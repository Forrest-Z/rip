/**
 * Multi-Axes Smooth Trajectory Planner (MultiSTP)
 * \author Robert Haschke, Erik Weitnauer
 * \date 2007, 2008
 *
 * With this class you can plan a smooth trajectory with a given number of
 * joints in a way all joints finish there movement at the same time. You
 * can choose, whether 2nd or 3rd order equations for the movement should
 * be used.
 * 2nd order:
 * Acceleration impulses are given, the speed changes linear. Values for
 * maximum acceleration and maximum and initial speed must be provided.
 * 3rd order:
 * Enormously more complex computation. Jerk impulses are given, so the
 * acceleration changes linear and the speed changes in a quadratic manner.
 * Values for max. jerk as well as max. and initial acceleration and speed
 * must be provided.
 *
 * This class uses a STP object for every joint.
 *
 * For further information about the theory of the used algorithm
 * \see "On-Line Planning of Time-Optimal, Jerk-Limited Trajectories";
