# Appendages

An appendage needs to be created for each sensor or actuator that will be connected to the arduino

## How to create an appendage

There are 4 files that need to be created for each appendage. 2 for ArduinoGen as templates for the code to be written and a header and source for RIP to be used in the dominate code

### ArduinoGen

The first file needed for ArduinoGen is the xml file used for templating the Arduino Code

#### Includes

#### Constructors

#### Setup

#### Loop

#### Commands

#### Core


#### Extra

### RIP

#### Header

#### Source

#### Registering Appendage
